## Description
The Unity Roomba is a 3D simluation of a Roomba moving within a space. There are various obstacles such as furniture and rugs which cause the robot to turn in search of a viable path. There are also walls which keep the robot within a pre-defined area (Room).

Throughout the space there are a series of "dirt" particles which can be collected. Both the movement of the robot and its collection of these particles consume battery life, which is displayed throughout the simulation.

Once the robot has run out of viable moves forward, it displays statistics about the current simulation such as how much of the potential grid was explored (the potential is based on all locations which contain a tile or dirt, as furniture/ walls cannot be traversed).

Future iterations will examine the effectiveness of various pathing algorithms in different kinds of spaces.
